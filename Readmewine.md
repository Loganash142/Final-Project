Wine Quality Dataset Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes the Red and White Wine Quality datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective is to explore the chemical properties of red and white wines, compare their characteristics, and investigate how these properties relate to wine quality scores. The analysis includes data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and exploratory data analysis, providing actionable insights for wine producers, distributors, and enthusiasts.
Purpose
Summarize key physicochemical properties of red and white wines.
Identify which chemical properties show the most and least variation.
Compare chemical profiles between red and white wines.
Determine the most common values for important properties like pH and alcohol.
Analyze the distribution of wine quality scores by wine type.
Provide recommendations for quality control and future analysis.
